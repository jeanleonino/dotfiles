# My dotfiles

This is my new list of[dotfiles](dotfiles.github.io) for my personal laptop,
right now this is optimized for MacOS. 

Personally, I'm using more `VS Code` lately, but I love me some well set up vim.
I'm using `iTerm2` with `zsh` and `oh-my-zsh`. 

Check the other branchs for my old Ubuntu/Debian dotfiles.

## vim Vundle
You gotta install [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) manually.
