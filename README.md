# My dotfiles
This is the list of [dotfiles](dotfiles.github.io) for my Debian/Ubuntu personal
laptop. I use vim but also sublime/atom lately, so don't strange my vim conf
files :-). I also use zsh.

## vim
I use the following plugins:

* [nerdtree](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree)
* [vim-sensible](https://github.com/tpope/vim-sensible)
* [vim-wakatime](https://github.com/wakatime/vim-wakatime)
* [pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)
